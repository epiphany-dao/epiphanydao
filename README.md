Epiphany DAO is a venture "Inceptor", targeting the ideation and creativity layers that come before an idea reaches Incubators and Accelerators. 

It is a diverse "brainstorming" community that will build and contribute on ideas presented to it, not by using the industry's vernacular and jargon, but in actual visual form. Pictures are, indeed, worth a thousand words, if not more. 

The magic with the "ethereal" world of web3 is that it brings people together. Epiphany DAO offers the freewheeling ecosystem for an idea to be expressed and for the Community to select it as a viable project and build onto it. Here, unstructured concepts turn into actual changemakers by receiving work contributions by the members of the Community. 

We "hack" human behaviour to overcome competitiveness and learn to collaborate with each other, envision and build ventures together, start friendships and form efficient teams. It is a brainstorming Community based on equal chances, openness, inclusivity and creativity. 

From a technical perspective the two pillars that support and define EPIPHANY DAO are, 

a. an unimpeachable recording of the "provenance" of every idea and contributions made in each project, thus safeguarding the rights on the venture's earnings for every generation of contributors

b. a dillution mechanism that will automatically represent the equity structure in the venture as fractionalised ownership into the venture's "Epiphany" NFTs

An "Epiphany's" journey is simple and inelaborate. An ideator creates the visual representation of their ideas and submit those, alongside venture summaries, to the DAO's Community communication channels. The DAO will hold, ideally, three "Inception Rounds" annually, where new "Epiphanies" will ask for the Community's votes to proceed into "Inception Stage". 

Once an "Epiphany" is selected, and up to four per "Inception Round", a collaboration channel opens for the venture. Now the DAO Members can work together through specialised guilds, i.e. business development, technical development, financial modelling, market research and mentoring. A novel idea that catalyses change will be then formulated, gain structure and scale to a market deployable point. 

The development of each venture will be marked by the minting of a representing "Epiphany". It will evolve from a simple sketch, to a consise and more detailed, aesthetic NFT. All generations of those minted NFTs will gain value corresponding to the venture's growth. 

Everyone involved in the DAO's ecosystem benefits. The "epiphany" creator's contribution has actual value and they hold a stake in each venture. Contributors can spare their free time and work on projects as a side hustle and those that do not have actual web3 experience, can build a contribution portofolio in Epiphany DAO. 

Last but not least, the industry benefits from an ecosystem that promotes interaction and collaboration between individuals that simulates almost the openess of a Hackathon. Conveying information in the form of a picture changes the way we comprehend and interact with complex concepts. It is interesting to see from a cognitive science perspective if and how a symbolic language will evolve through successive "epiphany" submissions


## Technical Solution

Epiphanies are smart contracts that split royalties and future revenue around a project dynamically between multiple owners in the form of ERC1155
tokens. 
Supporters of funds or work can offer funds directly to Epiphanies, receiving a propotional number of project ERC1155 tokens. Since each Epiphanie's ERC5511 tokens can be transferred or sold on NFT marketplaces by their owners, they can be seen as tradable royalties. Epiphanies can also create and manage their own merchandise and create additional revenue streams at any stage of their evolution, retroactively funding all attributed contributors. This creates a novel way to fund and coordinate around Epiphanies to make them realities.
